[Overall Objective:
This is a new thread prompt to convert Visual C++ to new python programs
after through and completely analysis and understanding on Visual C++ programs.
the business logic of source and target projects should keep coincidence with each other.
If it makes errors or failures during converting process,
prompt the answer to settle down them step-by-step.
]

1. Project Overview
- The source programs consist of a GUI screen for Korean morphological analysis,
  an engine program in C++ with dictionary data.
- The source project folder  F:\EngineX   as root folder (Visual C++ programs),
  and should not be changed or modified by you(AI) absolutely.
  The target project folder  F:\Engine_py as root folder (Python programs).
- if needing, make subfolders from the target root folder as naming rules reasonably.
- The sourceprograms are provided as a Visual C++ program, 
  which must be compiled or built to generate an .exe file.
- Dictionary data are located at F:\EngineX\EngineX\Dictionary\All_*.txt files.
- The executable file references the dictionary data for execution.
- If you find out some requirements or involvement of human during executing, 
  you should specify them with holding time. 
- If errors are found from the source program, you can modify or correct only target programs by logging 
  the list in detail.

2. Analyze the provided Visual C++ program source code.
2.1 The purposes of the analysis are as follows:
- Bug review 
- Performance optimization
- Application of a new programming language (Python)
- UI improvement

2.2 UI improvement guide:
- UI result screen file is on F:\EngineX\실행파일UI.png
- In the attached execution result screen, 
  hide the columns at the back of the Morphological Analysis Result tab (bottom area) 
  except for the Original Text, Stem, and Ending columns.

3. Develop an application program in Python.
3.0 If you need any libraries or modules, you may import or install promptly without my acceptances.
    and also, you should provide all the process and guide to set up the environment in detail.
3.1 The screen should be developed using Python QT.
3.2 Use the list of dictionary data from the existing program.

 so that other programmers can analyze, understand, and improve the program.
 
 
4. Make executable program and prepare Output documents
4.1 Package the created program files into a compressed ZIP file.

4.4 Append detailed description to function or module level.

 
 
 
Notice
::set up the workspace with 2 project folders
::F:/Engine_py/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m app.main

From VS Code terminal (PowerShell):
Using ENV:
$env:ENGINEPY_DICT='F:\EngineX\EngineX\Dictionary'; python.exe main.py
Using CLI arg:
python.exe main.py F:\EngineX\EngineX\Dictionary




Implement a reversed trie (suffix trie) for endings to speed candidate lookup.
Integrate timing hooks (simple profiling) to compare old vs new ending search.
Add optional debug trace collection in AdvancedAnalyzer (rule sequence, candidates).
Create golden test harness scaffold (directory + README for placing C++ output pairs).
Run PyInstaller build and ZIP packaging to ensure no regressions.
Update README with new performance and debugging sections.



Here’s a concise step-by-step summary of what’s been done so far:

Project discovery and setup
Scanned the C++ project (EngineX) and identified core files and dictionaries.
Found/used the Python project skeleton (Engine_py) and set up a venv.
Installed dependencies (PySide6, chardet, pyinstaller, pytest).

GUI and UX
Implemented PySide6 UI showing exactly 3 columns: Original Text, Stem, Ending.
Fixed layout/indentation issues in app/main.py.
Added “Advanced algorithm” toggle.
Added “Debug trace” toggle with CSV export.

Dictionary handling
Implemented encoding-aware loader with cp949 fallback.
Bootstrapped auto-copy of dictionaries from the C++ project path when missing.

Core analyzers
Basic analyzer: longest-stem heuristic (baseline).
Advanced analyzer: trie-based stem lookup + reversed suffix trie for endings.
Normalization placeholder for final syllables.

Hangul utilities and rules scaffold
Added basic Hangul jamo helpers (decompose/compose/batchim).
Created exceptions pipeline (rule stubs) with initial irregular heuristics (e.g., ㅂ, 듣).

Performance work
Implemented and integrated a reversed suffix trie.
Wrote benchmark script comparing naive vs trie suffix lookups.
Ran profiling; on small samples, speed was comparable.

Debug tracing
Instrumented AdvancedAnalyzer to record candidates, chosen pair, rules, and timings.
Exposed enable/disable and data retrieval methods.
Wired GUI “Debug trace” to export analyze_debug_trace.csv.

Tests
Added pytest tests for Hangul utilities, advanced analyzer behavior, and suffix trie.
Added a test for debug trace output.
All tests passing (8/8).

Packaging
Updated build script to prefer venv’s PyInstaller.
Built one-file EXE (dist/EngineXPy.exe).
Built folder dist for NSIS (dist/EngineXPy/).
Created ZIP (EngineXPy.zip).
Installer script (tools/installer.nsi) prepared for NSIS compile.

Golden comparison
Added compare_golden.py to compare against the C++ output file.
Ran comparison and produced summary + mismatches CSV.
Current results: 2410 lines; 1294 full matches; 120 stem-only; 472 ending-only; 524 mismatches; 53.69% full match rate.

Health check
Build: OK (folder + onefile).
Tests: OK (8 passed).
UI requirements: OK (3 columns only).






Checklist:

Use your local venv
Launch the GUI with the EngineX dictionary via env or CLI arg
Optional: run from terminal
What I set up

Created launch.json with two entries:
EnginePy GUI (ENV): runs main.py and sets ENGINEPY_DICT=F:\EngineX\EngineX\Dictionary
EnginePy GUI (Arg: Dictionary): runs main.py with the dictionary path as a CLI argument
These use the new “debugpy” debugger type.
How to run in VS Code

###############################################################
Open F:\Engine_py in VS Code.
Select your interpreter: bottom-right status bar > Python: 
  Select Interpreter > pick F:\Engine_py.venv\Scripts\python.exe.
Press F5, and pick:
“EnginePy GUI (ENV)” to use ENGINEPY_DICT, or
“EnginePy GUI (Arg: Dictionary)” to pass the path as an argument.
The app window should launch. 
Use File > Set Dictionary Folder… if you want to change it.
Run from terminal (optional)

From VS Code terminal (PowerShell):
Using ENV:
$env:ENGINEPY_DICT='F:\EngineX\EngineX\Dictionary'; python.exe main.py
Using CLI arg:
python.exe main.py F:\EngineX\EngineX\Dictionary

 
 
$pythonCode = "print('Hello from PowerShell using Python!')"
Invoke-Expression "& python -c ""$pythonCode"""




#############################################################################################
In the VC++ program (F:\EngineX),
1. Make the following UI modifications 
2. Generate an executable file (.exe) through the process to compile and build


UI improvement guide:
The UI result screen file is located at: F:\EngineX\실행파일UI.png
In the attached execution result screen, 
hide the columns at the back of the Morphological Analysis Result tab (bottom area), 
keeping only the Original Text, Stem, and Ending columns visible.
